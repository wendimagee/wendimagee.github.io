        <p>Hello! My name is Wendi Magee and I am a Detroiter looking to expand my career in Software development!
        I am particularly interested in back-end development and am currently in Grand Circus' Q1 2021 C#, .NET Coding Bootcamp. 
        I would love to join a growing company that fosters self improvement and autonomous learners. I have a long career of 
        teaching myself many skills, from starting my own business to renovating a historic home in Detroit! 
        I believe software development is the best avenue for utilizing my communication skills and "self-starter" qualities. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>About nine years ago, I started my business Artifex Detroit. 
        I had nothing to invest but my own time and money and I stepped out on a journey that I am happy to still be walking today.
        Over a number of years my products got more complex and my business bigger as my skills and knowledge grew. I have spent thousands of hours toiling away at my craft 
        and that is what I hear software programming is all about. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you would like to contact me, please feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn or email me at WendiMagee@gmail.com </p>
