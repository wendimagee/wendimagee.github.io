                    They app's primary users were staff at different locations of a chain of gyms.
                    The app allowed you to check in members, print invoices for members and CRUD member records.</td>
                <td>     This WPF app I completed before bootcamp to try to prepare for class. I have put this in my portfolio not so much
                    to showcase it's amazing back end capabilities, but to show that I have done work outside of bootcamp to further my education.

                <td>This app was my first attempt at true Object Oriented Programming!
                    No More Code Spaghetti! It was nice to be able to start to see how larger 
                    and more complex programs are built.
